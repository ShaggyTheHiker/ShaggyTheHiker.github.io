        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <p>
            I am a fisheries professional and programmer who has worked with fish hatcheries and fish hatchery data in a variety of capacities for over 25 years. I have learned hatchery operations from a collection of hatchery managers, assistant managers, technicians and culturists with decades of experience raising fish. At the time I write this, I am approaching retirement. I wrote the Hatchery Information System program as a hobby, and it is a fascinating undertaking. Having spent so many years thinking about, and working on, hatchery data management, I am <a href=Rationale.html>quite ambivalent</a> as to whether or not there is enough benefit in any hatchery data management program to justify the cost, but if the benefit is there, then I strongly feel that the approach taken by Hatchery Information System is the correct one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hatchery personnel have a tendency to take their knowledge and head off into retirement. Every hatchery manager I have known has had a wealth of information stored away in their heads, only some of which was passed on to the next generation. I am the same way. I have no interest in selling software, especially in retirement, nor can I support it on my own. However, the concept is a good one, the program functions as intended, and there is much of value in it, even if there are <a href="The Future Direction.html">problems left to solve</a>. Therefore, I have created this as an entryway. If somebody has an interest in taking the project forwards, they can contact me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program has not been made publicly available for two reasons. The first is that I would feel responsible for maintaining the program. While I am interested in continuing to work on the project, I cannot be the sole support for a project of such size. The second reason is that, if anybody wants to take the project forwards in use, they should be allowed to decide what that means.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any questions or discussions can be sent to <a href="mailto: strainerch@hotmail.com">Hatchery Information System</a>. I am generally around, if not off on an adventure, and would be happy to talk to anybody about hatchery data and hatchery data management.
